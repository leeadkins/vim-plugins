Lee's Vim Plugins
------------------

I don't always use vim, but when I do, I use a lot of plugins.

My base setup is via [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).

Janus will read from a `~/.janus` directory that supports any git-repo based
vim plugins you might install using something like Pathogen.

This repo contains the small collection of plugins that I like which
aren't included in Janus by default.

To use it, just clone this into your own `~/.janus` directory. Make
sure to use `--recursive` so that the submodules are fetched.

Current Plugins
---------------

- Goyo: A simple distraction-free mode.
- Promptline: Make my zsh prompt match my vim status line.
- Airline: My vim status line
- Airline Themes: Obvs.
- vim-jsx: React JSX highlighting.
- Auto Pairs: Automatically create/delete pairs of brackets, quotes,
  and parens.
